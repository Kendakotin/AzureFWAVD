# Low-level architecture diagrams

This folder contains **implementation-view (low-level) diagrams** for each project.

- File naming matches the high-level diagram name with `_lowlevel.svg` appended.
  - Example: `assets/diagrams/03_hubspoke_firewall_avd.svg` → `assets/lowlevel/03_hubspoke_firewall_avd_lowlevel.svg`
- The website automatically renders the correct low-level diagram under each project's high-level diagram.

You can replace any SVG with your organization's official diagrams as long as you keep the same filename.
